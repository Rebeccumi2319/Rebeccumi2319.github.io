                                <p><span class="image left"><img src="images/pic04.jpg" alt="" /></span> My whole life I have loved animals and enrolled in Indiana University to get a degree in biology. However, while taking classes I developed an interest in chemistry. I decided to take the best of both worlds and pursue a degree in biochemistry. Along the way of my freshman year I was also introduced to computer science and found it to be very useful, especially with the evolving higher technology in the world. So, I added computer science as a minor.
                                    With the intention to get to know more people with the same interests, I joined the chemistry club and was especially looking forward to the science events for children. Sadly, with the pandemic most events have been canceled. Before the pandemic, I learned from some members about undergraduate research opportunities and an event hosted by the chemistry club gave me the chance to speak with a professor who allowed me to gain experience by assisting a graduate student with his projects. Working aside the graduate student I learned more about real world research and this helped me determine that working in some type of lab doing research is what I would like to do in the future. During the summer, since I was not able to go into the lab, I had the opportunity to use my computer skills by working on protein loop modeling projects with the graduate student. Having such projects outside of class has boosted my knowledge in so many different areas and has enforced my desire to continue in this path for a career. 
                                    The only reason I can study and choose the career path I desire is because of my very hard working parents. They themselves started from scratch and worked their way up. I am the youngest of three and my parents are now in their sixties working as hard as they did in their thirties to support my life goals. One special circumstance that most do not consider when looking at my parents' income is that they live in Japan where the cost of living is much higher than the United States. Gasoline costs an average of $2.56 per gallon in the United States, where in Japan a gallon of gasoline would cost around ¥505 (about $4.87). Milk costs around $3.60 per gallon in the United States, but in Japan a gallon of milk would cost around ¥940 (about $9.08). Therefore, my parents' income looks much better than it is when converted to U.S. dollars as it must be when filling out any financial information. Since I am a U.S. citizen and not an international student, I feel it is sometimes hard to realistically represent my parents' financial situation. 
                                    I do try to contribute financially with a job during the school year, but with wanting my studies to come first, I sometimes feel the need to limit the hours I work and wish I could help out more. To pursue my goals, graduate school will be a crucial stepping stone that comes with many expenses. Receiving any type of scholarship would be extremely helpful to complete my undergraduate degree and to save to continue on to graduate school.</p>
